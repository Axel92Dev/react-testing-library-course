[react-testing-library](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-testing-library).
It's going to be fantastic.

Prior testing experience is not necessary.

Install it with [NVM|https://github.com/creationix/nvm]
Then `nvm install v10`

## Setup:

Run these commands in your terminal to get yourself setup:

```
git clone https://github.com/Axel92Dev/react-testing-library-course
cd react-testing-library-course/
